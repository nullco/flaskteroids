# Intro

**Flaskteroids** (or Flask on Steroids) is a lightweight yet powerful Python MVC framework designed to provide the closest possible experience to developing web applications in **Ruby on Rails**, in the python world. By supercharging **Flask** with Rails-inspired conventions and structure, Flaskteroids enables developers to build full-featured web applications with unprecedented speed and elegance.

Our mission is to bring the proven productivity and developer happiness of Rails to the Python ecosystem, offering a batteries-included framework that emphasizes **convention over configuration**. This means you can focus on building great applications rather than boilerplate code, while maintaining the full power of Flask and its rich ecosystem.

Flaskteroids stays lean, fast, and secure by carefully selecting core dependencies and providing everything you need out of the box — from database management to background jobs — without unnecessary complexity.

## Features

- **Full MVC Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with Models, Views, and Controllers, just like Rails.
- **Elegant Routing**: Intuitive and resourceful routing that automatically generates RESTful routes for your resources.
- **Built-in ORM**: Seamless integration with SQLAlchemy and Alembic for database management and migrations.
- **Background Jobs**: Integrated with Celery for easy background job processing.
- **RESTful by Design**: Quickly build API routes with automatic JSON responses for data-oriented actions.
- **Powerful CLI**: A rich set of commands for generating models, controllers, mailers, scaffolds, and more — inspired by Rails generators.
- **Flask Compatibility**: Retains the full power of Flask and its rich ecosystem while adding Rails-like productivity.
- **Convention Over Configuration**: Sensible defaults and automatic discovery reduce boilerplate code.
