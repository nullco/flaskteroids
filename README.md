**Flaskteroids** (or Flask on Steroids) is a lightweight yet powerful Python MVC framework that supercharges **Flask** with a clean, elegant structure. Inspired by the best of **Ruby on Rails**, it brings clarity and productivity to your web development workflow.

Built on the philosophy of **convention over configuration**, Flaskteroids helps you move fast, write less code, and stay focused on what matters: building scalable, maintainable applications with confidence.

With a **batteries-included** approach and carefully chosen core dependencies, Flaskteroids stays lean, fast, and secure — giving you everything you need, and nothing you don’t.

## Features

- **Full MVC Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with Models, Views, and Controllers.
- **Elegant Routing**: Intuitive and resourceful routing.
- **Built-in ORM**: Seamless integration with SQLAlchemy and Alembic for database management and migrations.
- **Background Jobs**: Integrated with Celery for easy background job processing.
- **RESTful by Design**: Quickly build API routes with JSON responses.
- **Powerful CLI**: A rich set of commands for generating models, controllers, mailers, scaffolds, and more.
- **Flask Compatibility**: Retains the full power of Flask and its rich ecosystem.

## Installation

To get started, install the Flaskteroids package using `pip`:

```sh
pip install flaskteroids
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Creating a New App

Create a new Flaskteroids application using the `flaskteroids new` command:

```sh
flaskteroids new my_project
cd my_project
```

This creates a new directory called `my_project` with a standard application structure.

### 2. Running the Server

To start the development server, run:

```sh
flask run
```

Now, open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. You should see the Flaskteroids welcome page!

## Your First Feature: A Blog

Let's create a simple blog to see the power of scaffolding.

1.  **Create a new app:**
    This command will create a new Flaskteroids application in a directory called `my_blog`.

    ```sh
    flaskteroids new my_blog
    cd my_blog
    ```

2.  **Generate a Post scaffold:**
    This command will create the model, controller, views, and database migration for a `Post` resource with `title` and `content` fields.

    ```sh
    flask generate scaffold Post title:string content:text
    ```

3.  **Run the database migration:**
    Apply the changes to your database schema.

    ```sh
    flask db:migrate
    ```

4.  **Start the server:**

    ```sh
    flask run
    ```

Now, visit `http://1227.0.0.1:5000/posts` in your browser. You have a complete set of pages to create, view, update, and delete posts.
